# 11.  Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the i$^{th}$ line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the _maximum amount of water a container can store_.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

## Example 1:

>**Input**: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
>**Output**: 49
>**Explanation**: The above vertical lines are represented by >array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

## Example 2:

>**Input**: height = [1,1]
>**Output**: 1



## Constraints:

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 104`

##My Answer

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} height
 * @return {number}
 */
function maxArea(height) {
  let largestArea = 0;
  height.forEach((h, i) => {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < height.length; j += 1) {
      const currentPosition = i;
      const targetPosition = j;
      const currentHeight = height[i];
      const targetHeight = height[j];
      const shortestHeight = targetHeight < currentHeight ? targetHeight : currentHeight;
      const area = (targetPosition - currentPosition) * shortestHeight;
      largestArea = area > largestArea ? area : largestArea;
    }
  });

  return largestArea;
}
```
